		<h3 class="textdecor">Short Term Goals</h3>
		<p>I regrettably underachieved at school and college, so I am incredibly grateful for this amazing opportunity.  My number one goal is therefore to give 100% in every unit of
		<br> this fantastic MMU government funded bootcamp and achieve a first class pass grade.</p>
		<h3 class="textdecor">Mid Term Goals</h3>
		<p>To secure a career switch into the tech industry by January 2022.  I don't have a clearly defined career path yet, but I love to code and hope that upon completion <br>
		of this course in mid November, to have a much clearer picture.  At present my top choices would be to secure an apprenticehip in either:<br>
		Software Development, Cyber Security or Web Development.
		</p>
		<h3 class="textdecor">Long Term Goals</h3>
		<p>5 to 10 years from now I hope to be fully skilled, and progressing within a tech company with great staff morale and productivity, possibly as a Project Manager.<br>
