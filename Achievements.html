	<h3 style="text-align: center; text-decoration:underline">PERSONAL PROFILE</h3>
	<div id="enclosed">I really want to help people, without them ever knowing who helped them or maybe that they were even helped at all! <br>
	I am an ambitious, motivated, team player with an analytical, problem solving mindset, 
		good attention to detail, strong communication skills and used to working well under pressure.<br>
		My CV shows a successful (top 5-10%) 20-year sales career, mostly in the travel industry.
		I've just turned 40 and achieved everything that I intended throughout my sales career so now is the perfect time to 
		pursue an evergrowing passion for coding and hopefully secure a career switch into the exciting rapidly expanding tech industry as soon as possible.
